### macOS Build Scripts (x86_64 and arm64)

For macOS users, we provide specialized build scripts to create architecture-specific and universal binaries:

- `build_macos.sh`: Builds separate x86_64 and arm64 versions
- `create_universal_binary.sh`: Creates universal binaries combining both architectures

See `MACOS_BUILD.md` for detailed instructions on building for both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.
